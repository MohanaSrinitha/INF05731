It is an experience with so much detail and attention to important things that motivated the physicist to come up with such a groundbreaking idea. This film proves to you why this was the most historical thing to happen, rather than just saying it. It opens your curiosity and wonder through the first half and as soon as the trinity test begins, it is nerve racking and intimidating how suspenseful the results are. The last half may seem like it's beginning to go nowhere, but redeems itself and shows the most powerful political message. It shows that after all of the contributions Robert Oppenheimer gave to the government to make sure this would work, he was now betrayed and left to the side after they took advantage of his work. It shows that our society needs to be careful and know that others may corrupt your accomplishments and take advantage of you, and have nothing to do with you. The last half was not only just a result of what the bomb did for the world, it shined on an insanely important political message.

            "Sentence: \"The summer block buster! Oppenheimer probably and should win a few awards. Old days Oppenheimer would be just another good movie! A bit over hyped, but because Hollywood is so repetitive and woke. The public is tired of another super hero c g i movie, and/or wokism's disjointed stories characters and lectures etc. In contrast, Oppenheimer is just a true believable, and interesting story of a complexed flawed genius! Murphy best role, Redeye was good too, of a arrogant, self absorbed, selfish complex man who carried the weight of helping make a dooms day weapon. One experiences the academic silliness of who's smarter, the insensitivity/naïve of brilliant academic people. If anyone ever teaches or works in a lab one has seen this! Oppenheimer at the level of being so smart almost insane we get a glimpse of the apple part of the movie! Oppenheimer goes from black and white of how others see Oppenheimer and colors of how the protagonist see himself. The story blends Oppenheimer personal struggles with the the enormity of building of Los Alamos! Communist leaning intellectuals, infighting with the staff, mixes with the military and the project and ending a war sub stories. A good mix part war movie, part 80's soap opera. Matt Damon's character pushes forward the story of the general who knew how to push the smartest man in the room forward. Matt should get best supporting actors here. Well written, acted and crafted by the director Oppenheimer goes full circle of the frailties of jealous, arrogantly self absorbed political side of film which is identical to the academic characters which hits Oppenheimer when the scientist is no longer of use. A good crafted story, a heavy watch, but Oppenheimer did not feel like a 3 hour movie. 7 or 8 stars.\",summer block buster oppenheimer probably win award old day oppenheimer would another good movie bit hyped hollywood repetitive woke public tired another super hero c g movie andor wokisms disjointed story character lecture etc contrast oppenheimer true believable interesting story complexed flawed genius murphy best role redeye good arrogant self absorbed selfish complex man carried weight helping make doom day weapon one experience academic silliness who smarter insensitivitynaïve brilliant academic people anyone ever teach work lab one seen oppenheimer level smart almost insane get glimpse apple part movie oppenheimer go black white others see oppenheimer color protagonist see story blend oppenheimer personal struggle enormity building los alamo communist leaning intellectual infighting staff mix military project ending war sub story good mix part war movie part soap opera matt damon character push forward story general knew push smartest man room forward matt get best supporting actor well written acted crafted director oppenheimer go full circle frailty jealous arrogantly self absorbed political side film identical academic character hit oppenheimer scientist longer use good crafted story heavy watch oppenheimer feel like hour movie star\n",

It moves from scene to scene very quickly in a non-chronological order but you're never lost either. There are lot of scientific jargon which is to be expected as this is about the making of the nuclear bomb. However, the excellent screenplay makes these relatively understandable so that non-scientist can easily comprehend what's going on. There is some great political tension in the 3rd act as well which was handled masterfully. In terms of story, it is juggling a lot with Oppenheimer's early life, the making of the bomb and the aftermath. Despite this, Nolan does an amazing job of exploring the character of Oppenheimer which shows all aspects of him, including his flaws. The constant build-up and tension to the bomb is incredibly engaging!\n",

            "Sentence: Ludwig Goransson, the composer of Tenet, returns for this film. His music score is wonderfully haunting with his use of violins. His music score illustrates the horror of the actions of these scientists. Hoyte van Hoytema also returns as the cinematographer. His cinematography is visually stunning and this is thanks to the practical sets, natural lighting and real locations used. On that note, the use of practical effects and no CGI is just so awesome to see. Nolan thankfully didn't use a real nuke but he still replicates it practically and it certainly shows! The realistic explosion meant it didn't take us out of the movie as you don't question the look of the explosion as it is real. When the explosion occurs, it is weirdly captivating and frightening to look at just like it was for the characters. The sound design is also a highlight as the sound of the explosion is impactful and even terrifying. The sound itself is the jump scare and it works. The only nitpick I have with this film, which is a common problem in Nolan movies is sometimes I just can't hear what the characters are saying because of the weird sound mixing. It isn't as bad here as it was in Tenet but it is still a problem.\n",

Oppenheimer isn't one of those Oscar-bait movies that were made to just win an Oscar. It was made to be enjoyable for everyone and that is why this film should win best picture.

        "The assignment was quite interesting and provided a good opportunity to apply various concepts and tools in natural language processing and text analysis from webscraping to entity recognition. One of the challenges I found was managing the large text input for processing, especially when dealing with memory constraints in spaCy. Splitting the text into smaller chunks helped to overcome this challenge, but it required careful handling to ensure that the text was processed accurately. Anther one was running asycio functions within google Colab. With this project I understood that you can't run another asyncio program within another and that the colab runtime already runs in asyncio process thus a loop. And you can't have another loop within it. What I enjoyed the most was the data collection (scraping with playwright) and the data cleansing part in preparation for the analysis.\n",
